Before you start viewing the samples, the following concepts may help you understand how to get started with Dynamsoft Document Normalizer.

### License

A network connection is required to verify the trial license in the samples. If your license is expired, you can go to the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=ddn&utm_source=documents" target="_blank">customer portal</a> to request for a private trial license.

### Video Document Normalizing

Most of the Dynamsoft Document Normalizer mobile samples are designed for video document normalizing. Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) is applied to the video document scanning samples. The following features in the samples are powered by DCE:

- Capture video frame for quadrilateral area detecting.
- Create a `Camera View` for displaying the video streaming and highlighting the real-time detected quadrilaterals.
- Create an `Image Editor View` for quadrilateral boundary editing.

View the [API reference](../api-reference/camera-enhancer/index.md) for more details.
